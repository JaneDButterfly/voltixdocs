# $VLTI

Vultisig fulfils four important purposes:

1. To raise capital to accelerate the product during its bootstrap phase
2. To buy users and AUM as quickly as possible using an Airdrop
3. To provide incentives to contributors to build the product
4. To allow anyone to support the adoption trajectory of the product
