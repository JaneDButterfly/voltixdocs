### Token Allocation

| Allocation            | Amount     | Description                                               |
| --------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launch Liquidity      | 80,000,000 | 80% is available at launch                                |
| 12 Month Airdrop      | 10,000,000 | 10% is distributed as an airdrop to users after 12 months |
| 5 year Annual Airdrop | 10,000,000 | 2% a year for 5 years                                     |

### Launch Liquidity

All of the initial raise of capital from external investors will be placed in a liquidity pool for launch.&#x20;

A 24hour whitelisted trade-only period will be the next phase. Then the pool will be opened for unlimited buys/sells.&#x20;

The following is an indication of how the launch could go, and the subsequent 12 months.

### LP Ownership

Instead of the direct token ownership, the Launch Liquidity is split between:

* Treasury (no cliff)
* DEV (12mo cliff, 5 year vest)
* Investors (12mo cliff)
* Liquidity (12mo cliff, 5 year lock)

This guarantees:

1. Maximum liquidity for the asset
2. Minimum FDV
3. No non-circulating tokens with the exception of Airdrop Allocation

Tokens are auto-sold through the pool on behalf of LP Owners as the market interacts.&#x20;
