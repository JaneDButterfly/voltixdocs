## Launch Liquidity

All of the initial raise of capital from external investors (tentatively USD $2m) will be placed in a liquidity pool for launch, together with 80m $VLTI (80% of total supply). Thus, FDV begins at $2.5m.

A 24hour whitelisted (WL) trade-only period will be the next phase (first come, first served among the WL addresses). Each WL address can execute only one single buy transaction, with a maximum of $10k. Sell transactions are also allowed during this period (but only whitelisted addresses who first bought, will have any $VLTI to sell). 

After 24 hours, the pool will be opened for unlimited buys/sells.

The following is an indication of how the launch could go, and the subsequent 12 months.

## LP Ownership

Instead of the direct token ownership, the Launch Liquidity is split between:

* Treasury
* DEV (12mo cliff, 5 year vest)
* Investors (12mo cliff)
* Liquidity (12mo cliff, 5 year lock)

This guarantees:

1. Maximum liquidity for the asset
2. Minimum FDV
3. No non-circulating tokens with the exception of Airdrop Allocation

Tokens are auto-sold through the pool on behalf of LP Owners as the market interacts.&#x20;

## Further Information

* The parties with 12mo cliff (DEV, Investors & Liquidity) will not be able to withdraw from the LP during the vesting period. However, $VLTI can still be freely bought/sold through the LP.
* Investors have claim to 20% of the launch liquidity, thus they are buying at $12.5m FDV.
* The first buy during the WL launch will be at $2.5m FDV.
* The first $3m worth of buys during the WL launch will be at/below $12.5m FDV.
