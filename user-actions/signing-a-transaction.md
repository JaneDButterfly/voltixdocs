# Signing a Transaction

1. Depending on your Vault types (2-of-2, 2-of-3 or 3-of-4), you need to have the requisite number of devices ready for the signing process.&#x20;

2. On one of your device, prepare the transaction (e.g. Send or Swap). When ready, click on **Continue**.&#x20;

3. Confirm all the details on the Verify screen, check all boxes for the reminder messages, and click **Sign**.&#x20;

4. On the Pair screen, a QR code will be generated. Choose the correct option: whether your other devices are in the same **Wifi** or **Hotspot** network, or using **Cellular** connection.

5. *On your other devices*, after selecting the same Vault, click the **Camera** icon and scan the QR code shown on the first device.
