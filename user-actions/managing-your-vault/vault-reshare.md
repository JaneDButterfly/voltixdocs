# Vault Reshare

Reshare is a feature that allows you to reshare each share to the other devices in the Vault, as well as increase or decrease the number of parties.

Do this if you have lost a device, and want to include a new, unique device.&#x20;

To reshare the vault, please follow the instruction to create a Vault: [#setup](../creating-a-vault.md#setup "mention")

{% hint style="warning" %}
When you "remove" a device from your vault, make sure that the backup file is also completely deleted. It is not cryptographically possible to make old backups unusable.
{% endhint %}
