# Vault Reshare

Reshare is a function where you can reshare the individual shares to the other devices in the vault, as well as upgrade or downgrade the number of parties.

To reshare the vault please follow the instruction to create a Vault: [#setup](../creating-a-vault.md#setup "mention")

{% hint style="warning" %}
When "removing" a device from your vault, make sure that the backup file is also deleted completely. As cryptographically it is not possible to render old backups useless.
{% endhint %}
