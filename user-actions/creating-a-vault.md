# Creating a Vault

### Setup

You first need to download the Voltix App to 2 or more devices.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only Macbook (M1), iPad and iPhones are supported. Find the app in the app stores (for Mac, look under "iPad Apps")
{% endhint %}

### Vault Types

The vaults will be m-of-n, where m is at least 2/3rds of n, and no maximum number of n devices. The more devices you use, the longer it will take to process any transactions.

The following are the most common vaults:

1. **2 of 2 vault** - only need two to create a vault and two to sign a transaction. Note, it is not automatically "redundant" so you absolutely should export the vault shares and store them separately and securely. This will be the most popular vault type since it is the most convenient.&#x20;
2. **2 of 3 vault** - three devices to create a vault and two to sign a transaction. This is automatically backed (one device is the backup) so you don't need to export vault shares. But you may choose to do this.&#x20;
3. **3 of 4 vault** - four devices to create a vault and three to sign a transaction. This is automatically backed (one device is the backup) so you don't need to export vault shares. But you may choose to do this.&#x20;

### Steps

1. On all your devices, click **Create a New Vault**. Note: if your devices already have existing vaults, first click **Add New Vault** to access this page.

3. On the next screen, select **WiFi**, **Hotspot** or **Cellular**. If using WiFi or Hotspot, all devices must be on the same network.

5. The camera function will be enabled, and use it to scan the QR Code displayed on the *first device*. Once joined, it will show the "Waiting for key generation to start" message.

8. The vault key generation process will start and once completed, your vault/address will be ready for use.

Note: The above screenshots illustrate a 2-of-2 vault creation, but the process is similar for any m-of-n vaults.
