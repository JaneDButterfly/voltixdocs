# Managing your Vault

## Vault Functions

Select a vault and on the top right, edit button.

### Details

This is where you see the details of your vault, including parties and public keys

### Backup

This is where you can export a vault share. Remember - vault shares do not store funds and it is safe to export them.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not store vault shares of the same vault from different devices in the same location as it means a malicous party can re-construct your vault.
{% endhint %}

### Rename

You can rename your vault. Note, it only renames the local vault name, and doesn't affect other devices.

### Reshare

Reshare is a function where you can kick out other devices in the vault, as well as upgrade or downgrade the number of parties.
