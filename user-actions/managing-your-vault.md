# Managing your Vault

### Vault Functions

Select a vault and on the top right, edit button.&#x20;



#### Details

This is where you see the details of your vault, including parties and public keys

#### Backup

This is where you can export a vault share. Remember - vault shares do not store funds and it is safe to export them.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do not store vault shares of the same vault from different devices in the same location as it means a malicous party can re-construct your vault.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Rename

You can rename your vault. Note, it only renames the local vault name, and doesn't affect other devices.&#x20;

#### Reshare

Reshare is a function where you can kick out other devices in the vault, as well as upgrade or downgrade the number of parties.&#x20;
