# Privacy

## Privacy Policy

At Voltix, safeguarding user privacy is paramount. We pledge to never store any user information unless explicitly provided by the user. The only information Voltix may retain, following adequate disclosure to the user, includes:

**ECDSA and EdDSA Public Keys:** These keys may be associated with Voltix vaults and can be utilized to derive on-chain addresses, which exposes address balances and other on-chain activities.

**On-chain Transactions:** Transactions involving the `v0` affiliate may be logged for operational purposes.

## Plausible Deniability

**Absence of Proof:** Voltix ensures that no evidence is created or stored to ascertain that a public key provided by a user belongs to a Voltix vault or that the user is a Voltix user.

**Transaction Privacy:** Similarly, Voltix guarantees that no evidence is generated or retained to confirm that an on-chain transaction involving the `v0` affiliate originates from a Voltix vault or a Voltix user.

## Information Never Stored

**User Details:** Voltix refrains from storing any user-specific details, including IP addresses or real-world addresses, to uphold user privacy.

**Vault Shares or Key Material:** Voltix will never retain any vault shares or key material.

## Canary Statement

In the event of any alterations to this privacy policy, the canary statement will be removed as an indication of such changes.

By utilizing Voltix, users acknowledge and agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. Should you have any inquiries or concerns regarding privacy matters, please contact the devs in the discord.
