# Terms

By using Vultisig, you acknowledge and accept that you do so at your own risk. Potential risks include, but are not limited to:

**App Store Restrictions:** It is possible that app stores may block the Vultisig application, resulting in limitations on accessing funds. To mitigate this risk, users are encouraged to back up vault shares upon creation and utilize alternative platforms such as iOS, Android, or web interfaces.

**Security Exploits:** There exists the possibility of a TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) or crypto zero-day exploit, wherein malicious parties could gain unauthorized access to key-generation or key-signing ceremonies, compromising key material. Users can minimize this risk by exclusively conducting ceremonies in private settings using trusted devices.

**Critical Bugs:** Vultisig may encounter critical bugs that could corrupt vault shares, preventing users from accessing their funds. To address this risk, users are advised to export and import vault shares immediately after creating a vault on alternative platforms.

By agreeing to these terms, you absolve Vultisig developers and contributors of any liability in the event of fund loss resulting from your use of the Vultisig platform. Furthermore, you indemnify them against any and all claims related to your voluntary utilization of the platform.
