# Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the biggest differences between Vultisig and all the other cold and hot wallets out there?

All the other cold and hot wallets are single-sig, and they rely on one set of seed phrase and one piece of private key; while Vultisig is a Multi-Sig Multi-Device wallet that does not rely on seed phrases and no single-point-of-failure to enhance wallet security. [Reference](https://medium.com/zengo/threshold-signatures-private-key-the-next-generation-f27b30793b).

### Will it be possible to add tokens like ERC-20s on EVM blockchains, or SPL tokens on Solana, etc?

Yes.

### Will Vultisig support web apps or browser extension?

Yes, with partners, utilizing Vultisigner.

### Will it be possible to integrate Vultisig with Li-Fi (JumperExchange), and different platforms like Uniswap and others?

### What versions of iOS / iPhones are supported?

### Can users import their existing address into Vultisig?

The single-sig private key and seed phrase of existing addresses are single-sig wallets, and cannot be imported into a Vultisig - which is multi-sig wallet.&#x20;

### Can we bond RUNE/ provide liquidity on THORChain by using Vultisig and will it be counted for airdrop?

Yes, Vultisig will support this. It will be counted to airdrop value.&#x20;
