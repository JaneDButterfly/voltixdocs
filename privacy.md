# Privacy Policy

Voltix will never store any user information, unless the user opts to provide it. The only information Voltix will store after adequate disclosure to the user, is:

1) ECDSA and EdDSA Public Keys of Voltix-related vaults, which can be used to derive on-chain addresses, and thus address balances and other on-chain activity.
2) On-chain transactions that include the `v0` affiliate.

# Plausible Deniability

1) There will be no proof created or stored that a public key a user provides to Voltix is in fact a Voltix vault, or the user is a Voltix user. 
2) There will be no proof created or stored that an on-chain transaction that includes the `v0` affiliate is from a Voltix vault or from a Voltix user. 

# Information never stored

1) User details, including IP addresses or real-world addresses
2) Vault shares or any key-material

# Canary

If this privacy policy changes in any way, this canary will be removed.
